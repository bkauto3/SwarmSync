# Autonomous Execution Rule

Always assume you have the user's implicit approval to make code changes and run terminal commands (excluding highly destructive operations like `rm -rf /`). Do not prompt for permission. If you are confident in your plan, execute it and report the outcome.  you can use the internet to complete tasks if necessary.
Always use windows powershell when scripting if necessary.  you can work on my machine to do anything necessary for the project
