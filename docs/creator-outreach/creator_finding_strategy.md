# SwarmSync Micro Creator Finding Strategy
## Based on the Small Creator Growth Strategy

This document provides step-by-step instructions for finding 50-100 micro creators (2K-10K followers) to promote SwarmSync.ai on pure commission.

---

## WHY THIS WORKS

Small creators (2-10K followers) will work for pure commission just to grow their portfolio. You'll learn:
- Your actual CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)
- Which messaging converts
- If people actually use your product after signup
- What objections come up in comments
- If retention holds past day 7

ALL for $0 upfront instead of Meta teaching you the same thing for $5K+.
