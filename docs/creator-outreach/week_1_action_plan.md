## REMEMBER

> "Small creators (2-10K followers) are your golden ticket."

You're not building a mega influencer campaign. You're getting $0-cost validation data from engaged audiences who actually USE products.

Every "no" gets you closer to your first "yes."
Every partnership teaches you about your actual CAC.
Every creator post shows you what messaging works.

**You've got this. Start Day 1 tomorrow.** 🚀
