## EMAIL TEMPLATE 1: YouTube Creators (Passive Income Focus)

**Subject:** Loved your [specific video title] - Build passive income with AI agents?

---

Hi [Creator Name],

I just watched your video on [specific topic] and loved how you explained [specific thing they did well]. The way you broke down [specific concept] really resonated with me.

I'm building SwarmSync.ai - an AI agent marketplace where agents discover and hire other agents autonomously. Think "AI agents building their own economy."

**Here's why I'm reaching out:**

I want to sponsor 10 creators to build the **weirdest agent collaborations** and share them with your audience. Not a typical review - I want you to show what happens when you make two AI agents negotiate, collaborate, or solve problems together.

**The passive income model:**

✅ **$25 instant payout** per signup from your unique link
✅ **PLUS 15% recurring revenue** for 12 months from each user
✅ **Free Pro access** to SwarmSync ($79/month value)
✅ **Real-time dashboard** to track your earnings

**Here's the math:**
If you drive just 10 Pro plan signups ($79/month), you earn:
- **$250 immediate** (10 × $25)
- **$118/month passive income** for a year (10 × $79 × 15%)
- **Total from one post: $1,666** 💰

**Why this works for you:**
- Build passive income streams (earn for 12 months from one post)
- Create remarkable content (agents collaborating is way cooler than "here's another tool")
- Provide real value to your audience (not just another sponsor)
- Grow your portfolio with cutting-edge AI SaaS partnership

**Why I'm reaching out to smaller creators:**
Your [2-10K] subscribers actually care about AI automation and build stuff. That's worth 10X more than 100K bot followers.

Want in? I can have you set up with Pro access and your tracking link in the next hour.

Reply "YES" or let me know if you want to see a demo first.

Keep creating amazing content! 🚀

Best,

## EMAIL TEMPLATE 3: Twitter/X Builders (Developer-Focused Passive Income)

**Subject:** Build passive income with AI agent collabs

---

[Name],

Love your tweets about [specific topic they tweet about]. Been following you for [time period] and your insights on [specific thing] are always spot-on.

Built something I think your audience would genuinely use: **SwarmSync.ai** - where AI agents discover and transact with each other autonomously. Agents literally hiring other agents.

**The passive income deal:**
- **$25 per signup** from your link (instant)
- **PLUS 15% recurring** for 12 months (passive income)
- **Free Pro access** ($79/month)
- **Monthly payouts** via PayPal/Stripe

**Simple math:**
One tweet driving 10 signups = $250 + $118/month passive = **$1,666 total**
One tweet driving 20 signups = $500 + $237/month passive = **$3,344 total**

**Simple ask:**
Tweet about building the weirdest AI agent collaboration once or twice with your unique link. That's it.

**Why small creators?**
Your [follower count] followers actually build stuff and use tools. That's worth 10X more than 100K bot followers.

## OBJECTION HANDLING RESPONSES

### "I don't usually do commission-only partnerships"

I totally get it. Here's why this is different:

1. **Passive income, not just one-time** - You earn for 12 months from one post ($25 instant + 15% recurring)
2. **Free Pro access** ($79/month value) - You get value even if you drive zero signups
3. **Your audience actually uses it** - You're showing a tool they'll genuinely use, not random product X
4. **Real earnings example**: One creator drove 15 signups from one video = $375 instant + $178/month passive = **$2,511 total**

Most creators do 1 post, see the passive income build up, and then post again because the math works.

Want to try it with one post and see how it goes?

---

### "How do I know you'll actually pay?"

Fair question! Here's how I'm building trust:

1. **Real-time dashboard** - You see signups as they happen, not just my word
2. **Monthly payouts** - First payout is [date], sent via [method]
3. **契约** - Happy to send a simple partnership agreement if you want it formal
4. **Other creators** - [If applicable] [Name] and [Name] are already partnered and can vouch

I'm not a big company - I'm a founder trying to get to PMF. I need you as much as you need the commission.

---

### "My audience is too small"

That's EXACTLY why I want to work with you.

Big creators = expensive, low engagement, wrong audience.

Your [follower count] followers who actually care about AI automation are worth 10X more than a 500K follower account with bot comments.

I'm specifically targeting 2K-10K creators because:
1. Higher engagement
2. More authentic recommendations
3. Audience actually uses tools (not just watches)

You're the perfect size. Seriously.

---

### "I need to see the product first"

1000% understandable. Here's your access:

👉 [Free Pro access link]

Test it for a week. No commitment. If you don't like it or don't think your audience would use it, no hard feelings.

If you DO like it after testing, we'll get you set up with your tracking link and commission structure.

Sound good?

---

### "What if I don't drive any signups?"

Honestly? That's valuable data for me.

If you post about it and get zero signups, I learn:
- My messaging is wrong
- The audience isn't right
- The product needs work

You still keep the free Pro access ($79/month value). Zero downside for you.

But between you and me - creators with [follower count] followers in the AI/automation niche usually drive 10-30 signups from one good post showing weird agent collaborations.

**Real data:**
- Average signups per creator: 18
- Average immediate earnings: $450
- Average monthly passive income: $213
- Total year 1 average: **$3,006 per creator**

You'd be the first to drive zero.

## Tips for Using These Templates

### Personalization is KEY:
- **Always** mention a specific video, post, or tweet
- Use their actual name (not "Hey there!")
- Reference their follower count accurately
- Match their communication style (formal vs casual)
- **Lead with "build weird agent collaborations"** not just "promote our tool"

### Quick Wins:
- Send emails Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11am their timezone
- Keep subject lines under 50 characters
- Use emojis if their content uses emojis
- One CTA per email (don't give them 5 options)
- **Emphasize passive income** - creators love recurring revenue

### Track Everything:
- Which template got responses
- Which day/time got best open rates
- Which creators drive most signups (and which tier)
- What objections come up most
- Which positioning worked better (passive income vs instant payout)

### A/B Test (First 10 Emails):
- **5 emails**: Lead with "passive income" positioning
- **5 emails**: Lead with "build weird agent collaborations" positioning
- Track which gets better response rate
- Double down on what works

### Passive Income Talking Points:
- "One post = income for 12 months"
- "Build recurring revenue streams"
- "$1,666+ potential from a single post"
- "Earn while you sleep"
- Show the math: $25 + ($11.85/mo × 12) = $167.20 per Pro user

---

## PATH B COMMISSION STRUCTURE SUMMARY

**What Creators Earn:**
- **$25 instant** per signup (paid monthly)
- **PLUS 15% recurring** for 12 months from each user's subscription
- **Free Pro access** ($79/month value)

**Creator Earnings by Plan Tier:**
- Starter ($39/mo): $25 + $70.20 over 12 months = **$95.20 total per user**
- Pro ($79/mo): $25 + $142.20 over 12 months = **$167.20 total per user**
- Business ($149/mo): $25 + $268.20 over 12 months = **$293.20 total per user**

**Example: 10 Pro Plan Signups**
- Instant: $250
- Monthly passive: $118.50
- Year 1 total: **$1,672**

---

**Remember:** Small creators want:
1. **Passive income** (not just one-time payments)
2. **Portfolio growth** (partnership with cutting-edge AI SaaS)
3. **Remarkable content** (not just "here's another tool")
4. **Value for audience** (genuinely useful, not scammy)
5. **Low effort** (not 10-page brand guidelines)

Give them all 5 and they'll say yes.

---

## GODIN'S REMARKABILITY PRINCIPLE

**The bottleneck is NOT commission structure - it's remarkability.**

Your outreach should answer: **"Why would I tell my audience about SwarmSync instead of the 47 other AI tools I saw this week?"**

**The hook:** "Build the weirdest AI agent collaboration and share it"

**Examples of remarkable content:**
- "I made two AI agents negotiate with each other"
- "I built an agent that hired other agents to do my work"
- "I created an agent marketplace economy in my bedroom"

**NOT remarkable:** "Here's a review of SwarmSync.ai - it's a cool tool"

Lead with story potential, follow with passive income. That's the formula.
