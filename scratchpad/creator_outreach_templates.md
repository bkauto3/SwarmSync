- [Specific reason based on their content - e.g., "Your tutorials on building AI workflows would pair perfectly with showing how agents can collaborate autonomously"]
- [Another content alignment - e.g., "Your audience building no-code AI apps could monetize their agents on our marketplace"]

**Partnership Details:**
- [35%/40%] recurring commission for 12 months on all referrals
- $[75/100] bonus per qualified sign-up
- Free [Pro/Scale] tier access for you
- Co-marketing opportunities (case study, guest tutorial, etc.)
- Dedicated support and early access to new features

**What we'd provide:**
- Demo video and walkthrough
- Ready-to-use promotional graphics
- Custom affiliate tracking link
- Technical documentation for deep-dive content

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to discuss? I can show you the platform and we can explore how this could add value for your audience.

## Objection Handling

### "I'm too busy right now"

"Totally understand - content creation is a full-time job!

No pressure on timing. When would be a better time to revisit this? I can follow up in [1 month/next quarter].

In the meantime, would you be open to me sending you free access to try the platform? No commitment - just explore when you have time."

---

### "What's the time commitment?"

"Great question! We make this as easy as possible:

**Minimum effort:**
- Share your unique affiliate link (2 minutes to set up)
- Mention in video description or occasional post

**Medium effort:**
- 30-second mention in relevant video
- Instagram story / TikTok about the platform

**High-value collaboration:**
- Full tutorial (we provide support, code, and promotion)
- Case study feature
- Live stream or webinar

You choose the level that works for you. Some partners start small and expand if it resonates with their audience."

---

### "How much can I actually earn?"

"Fair question - here's the math:

**Conservative estimate:**
- 10 sign-ups per month (modest for your audience size)
- Average plan: $49/month Growth tier
- Your cut: 35% = $17.15/sign-up
- Monthly recurring: $171.50
- Plus $75 sign-up bonus × 10 = $750 first month
- **First month total: ~$921**
- **Month 12 (cumulative): ~$2,600/month**

**Active promotion:**
- 50 sign-ups per month
- **First month: ~$4,600**
- **Month 12: ~$13,000/month**

These are based on conversion rates we're seeing with early partners. Happy to show you their dashboards (anonymized)."

---

### "I've had bad experiences with affiliate programs"

"I totally get it - many affiliate programs under-deliver. Here's how we're different:

1. **High commission rates:** 35-40% recurring (most SaaS = 20%)
2. **Long cookie duration:** 90 days (many are 30)
3. **Transparent tracking:** Real-time dashboard
4. **Dedicated support:** Direct line to our team
5. **Co-marketing:** We promote your content too
6. **Proven conversions:** [X%] conversion rate so far

Plus we do monthly partner calls to share what's working and optimize together.

Want to talk to one of our current partners? Happy to intro you."

---

### "My audience might not be interested"

"That's a valid concern - let me share why I think there's alignment:

Your audience is [building AI tools/automating workflows/creating SaaS products]. SwarmSync solves [specific pain point based on their content].

**Here's my suggestion:**
1. Try the platform yourself (free Pro access)
2. If you see value, soft mention it
3. Check the response from your audience
4. Scale up if it resonates

No pressure to promote something that doesn't fit. I'd rather you genuinely love the product first.

Sound fair?"
