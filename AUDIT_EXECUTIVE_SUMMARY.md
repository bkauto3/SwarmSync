## Questions for Leadership

1. **Auth Issue:** Is there a known issue with the authentication system, or is this a new regression?
2. **Customer Availability:** Can we get testimonials from existing beta users within 2-3 days?
3. **Content Bandwidth:** Do we have marketing resources to create blog content weekly?
4. **Paid vs. Organic:** What's the priority—paid ads to test funnel, or fix organic conversion first?
5. **Dashboard UX:** Once auth works, what's priority—feature parity or user education?

---

## Conclusion

SwarmSync has a **strong technical foundation and market positioning**, but needs immediate action on authentication (critical blocker) and social proof (conversion blocker). With focused effort over 90 days, the platform can establish 5-7% trial conversion rates and build customer testimonial moats.

**Estimated Revenue Impact:** 50-100% increase in qualified signups + trial activations within 90 days.
